            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><i>Disclaimer: Psychadelic Mushrooms and the active componenet Psilocin and its phosphorylated counterpart Psilocybin are Federally Illegal in the United States 
                as Schedule I Drugs. This website is purely educational and does not condone breaking federal law.
                </i></p> <br>
            <p>Psilocybin Mushrooms are an informal group of fungus that contain the psychoactive chemical compound psilocybin, with the most potent and commonly used specimens being found in the “Psilocybe” genus. The effects of Psilocybin can be compared
                to those of LSD and DMT. </p> <br>
            <p>Psilocybin Mushrooms and Psychadelic Mushrooms are synonymous with each other, with the former referring to the active chemical within them, and the latter being the common name.</p> <br>
            <p>These fascinating fungi have been used in religious practices dating all the way back to before recorded history, with images of them being found in cave paintings.</p> <br>
            <p>Despite the near constant fear mongering campaign around psychedelics, and especially mushrooms, that has been kept up by the federal government and pharmaceutical industries over the past 70 years, the United States Food and Drug Administration
                has recently cleared them for medicinal use after an outpour of scientific studies on the subject over the past couple of decades.
